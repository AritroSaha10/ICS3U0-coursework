# Python Assignment 2

## Task
Choose a job/career that starts with the first letter in your first name (my first name begins with an S, so I could be a Sous Chef).

You will first complete the attached Requirement Analysis to plan out one function and how it will be used (see below for tips).  Only one function should be included in this plan, but you may want more than one in your final product.

When approved, write a program based on your job (focused on the use of your function).

The program doesn’t have to be very long/complicated for this assignment.  It should be creative (different from lessons/exercises), uses your function(s) multiple times, clearly documented and nothing crashes.
 
## Required Concepts
- Functions
    - At least one function with parameter(s) and return value
    - Function should be called multiple times to achieve different results
- Exceptions
    - Make use of try/except/raise where appropriate
    - Program should not crash (even incorrect input types)
- Documentation
    - All functions should have proper documentation.
    - Descriptive comments throughout (so that someone reading your code can follow what’s happening).
- Assertions
    - Any functions that have parameter(s)/return value should have at least 3 assertions (test cases).
- Logging
    - Significant events should be logged, make sure to provide detail (variables, returns, inputs etc)- Disable the logging prior to submitting, or log to file
    - Make sure to use appropriate levels (not just logging.debug)

## Project
The career I chose was an accountant. The program I made was an income tax calculator.

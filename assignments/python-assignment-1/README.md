# Python Assignment 1

## Task
You will be creating a program focused on a sport/activity/hobby that begins with the first letter of your last name (my last name is ‘Kowalczewski’ so I can do a program about ‘Kite Flying’).

Your program should:
- Allow the user to interact (`input()`)
- Performs some sort of Math (calculations) and Word options (question/answer)
- Includes all concepts (listed below)
- Has no similarity to lessons, exercises or other student work
 
## Required Concepts
- Header and Comments
    - Fully updated and accurate header
    - Descriptive comments throughout (one comment per ‘block’ can be sufficient)
- Variables
    - Operators (math) and Conversion
    - Descriptive naming in pot_hole_case or camelCase (consistent)
    - input()
- if statements
    - Including elif / else
    - And / or
    - Different comparisons (==, !=, < etc)
- while and for loops
    - Appropriate choice of loop for scenario
    - Not just accessing list
- Nested Structures
    - Structures inside of structures (If statements inside of loops, etc)
- Lists (or Dictionaries)
    - Initialize, access and modify
    - Justifiable use

## Project
I made "Squared Magic", a game where you have to solve a magic square as quickly as possible.
